# project-shell-tugas4
This project is made in order to complete the subject of Shell tooling from Pacmann.ai

First step, I downloaded the file from the Google Docs.
Second step, merging two files by using csvstack.
Third step, filtering the data by the event_type column with "purchase", and I turned it into new file
Forth step, I split the column from category_code in to category. Then I was going back to the new file to split the column for product_name.
Then, I remove the category_code column from the new file and make the new file, again.
And I finally merge it all together. (and rename the column)

I know my process is redundant but I was going back and forth to make this right. I really need a suggestion to make me do better.

Thank you
